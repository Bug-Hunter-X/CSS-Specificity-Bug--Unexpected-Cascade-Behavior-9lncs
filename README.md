# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected Cascade Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to CSS specificity and the cascade.  The bug showcases how a higher-specificity selector unexpectedly fails to override a lower-specificity selector, potentially leading to unexpected styling issues.

## Bug Description
The provided `bug.css` file contains CSS rules where the expected behavior based on CSS specificity is not met. A more specific selector is unexpectedly overridden by a less specific one.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` (not provided here, but it should contain a `<div id="myId" class="myClass"></div>`) in your browser.
3. Observe that the text color is unexpectedly green instead of red, demonstrating the bug.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution to the problem. This involves a careful review of selectors and specificity, and possibly restructuring the CSS to avoid such conflicts. This might require adding more specific selectors or using the `!important` flag as a last resort.
