The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascade.  The `#myId .myClass` selector should override `.myClass` because of its higher specificity.  However, due to an unexpected behavior (possibly related to inheritance or how a certain CSS property is handled), `.myClass` is still applied instead. This example highlights a subtle interaction between id selectors, class selectors, and the cascade that could be difficult to diagnose.

```css
#myId {
  color: blue; 
}

#myId .myClass {
  color: red;
}

.myClass {
  color: green;
}

#myId div.myClass {
  color:purple;
}
```

In this case, the element with id "myId" and class "myClass" will unexpectedly render with green text color instead of red or purple.
